## Interactive spider-web animation

This project is variation of my prevoius one: night-sky.
Here I wanted to make a modern look of connections between moving points, which look like some kind of spider-web.
I also really wanted it to be interactive so I added animation of user mouse connecting to other points.

At this project I sharpen my canvas animation skills and also learned how to measure distance between points
(it was crucial to make connection effect).

The big issue for me was to add disappearing lines effect, which is actually lowering the opacity value
when the particles are away from each other.

The things I want to improve:
- add the input fields which let the user to costumize the look of animation (line colors, bg color, size)
